/**
 * Canonical host redirect, and why it lives in middleware rather than config.
 *
 * The apex serves a redirect to www, and hstspreload.org reads the HSTS header
 * on the redirect response itself, not on the page it lands on. Two simpler
 * homes for that redirect were tried first and both fail to attach it:
 *
 * 1. A Vercel project-level domain redirect runs above the app entirely, so no
 *    code in this repo executes and Vercel emits its platform default for
 *    custom domains: `max-age=63072000`, with no `includeSubDomains` and no
 *    `preload`. That is what every dcyfr apex served before this change, and it
 *    is the whole reason none of them are preload-eligible.
 *
 * 2. A `redirects` entry in vercel.json does not inherit the `headers` block.
 *    Measured on a preview deployment of this repo: a 308 produced that way came
 *    back with no Content-Security-Policy and no X-Frame-Options, both present
 *    on a 200 from the same build. Route-table redirects short-circuit ahead of
 *    the headers block.
 *
 * A middleware response is an application response, so the vercel.json headers
 * do reach it. Measured the same way: the 308 below came back carrying the full
 * `/(.*)` set. The explicit list is kept anyway so the redirect cannot silently
 * lose the directive if that block is ever narrowed.
 *
 * This is inert until the project-level domain redirect for the apex is cleared
 * in the Vercel dashboard. While that redirect exists it wins and this code
 * never sees the request, which is what makes shipping it first the safe order.
